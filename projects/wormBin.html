                <p class="reveal-tldr">On a rainy day, I felt guilty for leaving an earthworm stranded, which led me to
                    research and create a worm bin in my dorm. A worm bin is a simple, closed-loop system where worms
                    (ideally red wigglers) break down compostable materials like kitchen scraps and paper into
                    nutrient-rich castings. I initially bought European nightcrawlers by mistake, but eventually got red
                    wigglers, which proved more efficient in processing food. Setting up a basic worm bin involves a
                    plastic container, bedding of shredded paper or cardboard, food scraps, and moisture, with optional
                    drainage holes for excess liquid. The goal is to maintain a balanced environment by controlling
                    moisture, temperature, and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, eventually harvesting the nutrient-dense
                    castings after a few months. In the end, I not only optimized a small indoor composting setup but
                    also saved 60 worms from becoming pet food.</p>

            <!-- Introduction Section -->
            <h2 id="Section 2">Intro</h2>
            <p>One rainy day, as I walked to class, I noticed an earthworm stranded on the sidewalk. It took me about
                ten yards before it occurred to me that I should've put it back in the dirt; but by then, I was too lazy
                to turn around, so I kept going. The guilt of leaving the poor worm to dry out or get stepped on weighed
                on me throughout my Systems Fundamentals class. Naturally, I found myself researching how to keep worms
                in my dorm.</p>
            <p>A worm bin is essentially a closed-loop system that mimics nature's decomposition process. Worms consume
                compostable materials like brown paper and food scraps, turning them into nutrient-rich worm castings
                (worm poop) and worm tea (worm casting juice). This process, called vermicomposting, comes from the
                Latin word vermis (meaning worm) combined with composting.</p>

            <div class="tidbit-container reveal">
                <h3 id="Section 1.1">Etymology</h3>
                <p>Composting also comes from Latin (compōnō, compōnere) meaning to arrange or make up (among many other
                    things).</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Process Section -->
            <h2 id="Section 3">Process</h2>
            <p>You barely need a guide to get started—it's exactly how you think it works. Get a bin, put the worms in
                it, add food, and place it somewhere cool and dark. But there are a few things you can do to optimize
                the process.</p>
            <p>First of all, I didn't know this before, but different species of worms are better suited for breaking
                down compost. Red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) and European nightcrawlers (Dendrobaena hortensis) are the
                two most common species. Red wigglers reproduce faster and process food more efficiently, while
                nightcrawlers are a bit better at handling colder temperatures. For my small, indoor setup, red wigglers
                are the best choice due to their quicker reproduction and ability to break down food faster.</p>
            <p>So, I began my preparations: first, I needed a bin for the worms and then some food. Worms thrive on a
                mix of nitrogen and carbon at about a 1:3-4 ratio—nitrogen coming from kitchen scraps, and carbon from
                things like paper or cardboard. I went dumpster diving around my dorm, hoping to find a discarded bin,
                but only managed to find some suitable paper scraps and a small protein powder tin. I ripped those up
                and stored them as bedding for the worms.</p>

            <img src="../images/wormBin/materials.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

            <p>Next, I headed to Home Depot, hoping to find red wigglers in the gardening section, but they didn't carry
                them in-store. So, I made my way to PetSmart, thinking they might sell worms as food for reptilian and
                amphibian pets. I got lucky and grabbed two packages of 30 red worms. Even though I said earlier that
                red wigglers were the best choice for my setup, I realized when I got back to my dorm that I had
                mistakenly purchased nightcrawlers. Oops. The packaging had the word "red" on the side. I'd call that
                false advertising, but I'm sure I can still make do with nightcrawlers, even if they aren't the ideal
                fit for an indoor bin.</p>

            <img src="../images/wormBin/nightcrawlers.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

            <p>I realized that the bin I had wasn't ready: usually you're supposed to drill holes at the bottom to allow
                for drainage of any excess moisture. I needed a temporary home for the worms until I could get my hands
                on an electric drill at the university's makerspace, so I settled on the protein powder container I had
                from dumpster diving. I put some of the shredded paper at the bottom, then dumped the worms in. They
                kind of just arrive in... a ball. It's cool, weird, and gross at the same time.</p>

            <img src="../images/wormBin/proteinCase.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

            <p>After that, I gently mixed them into the bedding and covered them with a bit more paper. I used a pocket
                knife to poke a hole in the lid for ventilation. It wasn't perfect, but it would do for now.</p>

            <div class="tidbit-container reveal">
                <h3 id="Section 2.1">“It wasn't perfect, but it would do for now.”</h3>
                <p>I've noticed I say that a lot when working on projects. In a dorm setting, where all you have are
                    your two hands and whatever happens to be lying around (which is usually not much), you often have
                    to make things up as you go. There's a certain excitement in figuring things out on the fly and
                    adapting to whatever resources you have at hand.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="Section 3.1">Upgrades</h3>

                <p>After a few days I moved the worms to a larger bin. I had an urge to optimize when I realized that I
                    had European Nightcrawlers, an urge that could only be satiated by buying Red Wigglers from a local
                    worm farm.</p>

                <img src="../images/wormBin/v2.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

                <p>These also arrived in a big ball, which I held this time. </p>

                <img src="../images/wormBin/sack.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">
                <img src="../images/wormBin/wigglers.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

                <p> I prepared a separate bin with a banana
                    peel and some strawberries which had fermented. I decided not to drill any holes because I realized
                    that drilling holes meant that smelly worm juice would be curdling somewhere in my dorm, so I'd
                    rather have a more active hand in managing the moisture levels.</p>

                <img src="../images/wormBin/v3.jpg" alt="" class="article-image reveal">

                <p>Now, I just have to wait a few months for my first harvest of those fertilizing nutrient-dense worm
                    castings!</p>

                <!-- Guide Section -->
                <h2 id="Section 4">Guide</h2>
                <p>I've compiled my findings into a simple guide you can follow to create a bare-bones worm bin at home.
                    If you're looking to invest more time and effort, you can definitely do much better—this is just the
                    basics to get you started. For more advanced setups, I recommend checking out a YouTube video for
                    additional details.</p>

                <h3>Materials:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Worm Bin:</strong> Any container that can serve as a bin—plastic bins work best. You can
                        find these at a local hardware store or even upcycle something you already have (an old storage
                        container, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Red wigglers (<em>Eisenia fetida</em>) are the preferred choice for
                        composting. You can find them at gardening stores, online, or pet shops (though be careful to
                        check the species).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bedding Material:</strong> Shredded paper, cardboard, dry leaves, or coconut coir. These
                        provide carbon for the worms and help balance moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kitchen Scraps:</strong> Vegetable peels, fruit scraps (like banana peels and apple
                        cores), and coffee grounds for nitrogen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture Source:</strong> Water to keep the bedding moist. Use a spray bottle on the
                        mist setting.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <h4>1. Prepare the Bin:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a bin that is appropriate for the number of worms you have. For a small indoor setup, a
                        bin with a capacity of around 5-10 gallons will do.</li>
                    <li>If using a plastic bin, drill a few small holes in the sides and lid to allow for ventilation.
                        For drainage, you can drill holes in the bottom and place a tray beneath the bin to catch any
                        excess liquid (optional, depending on your comfort with worm tea). Or not, if you don't want
                        that excess liquid stinking up the place.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Add Bedding:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place shredded paper, cardboard, or any other carbon source in the bin. The bedding should be
                        about 3-4 inches deep, enough for the worms to burrow in and feel comfortable.</li>
                    <li>Moisten the bedding. It should feel like a wrung-out sponge.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Introduce the Worms:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gently place the worms on top of the bedding. They will naturally burrow down into the material
                        away from the light.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Feed the Worms:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start small: add a handful of kitchen scraps like banana peels, apple cores, or coffee grounds.
                        Make sure to bury the scraps under the bedding to prevent fruit flies and odors.</li>
                    <li>Avoid feeding the worms any dairy, meat, citrus, or overly spicy foods as these can create
                        unsuitable conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Maintain the Environment:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Keep the bedding damp, but not soaking wet. If it's too dry, spray a
                        bit of water. If too wet, add some dry bedding like shredded paper or cardboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Worms do best at room temperature (around 55-77°F or 13-25°C).
                        Avoid extreme cold or heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Balance:</strong> Aim for a ratio of 1 part nitrogen-rich food scraps to 3-4 parts
                        carbon-rich bedding.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Harvesting Worm Castings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>After about 2-3 months, you will start to see dark, crumbly worm castings forming. This is a
                        sign that the worms have broken down the food and bedding.</li>
                    <li>To harvest, push the contents of the bin to one side and add fresh bedding and food to the empty
                        side. The worms will migrate over in a week or two, allowing you to scoop out the castings from
                        the old side.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>7. Managing Moisture Without Drainage Holes (Optional):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of drilling holes for drainage, you can control moisture manually by adjusting how much
                        bedding you add. If the bin becomes too wet, add more dry bedding. Keep an eye on the bin and be
                        proactive in maintaining a balance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In any case, I saved 60 worms from a certain fate of being food for some lizard or bird.■</p>
