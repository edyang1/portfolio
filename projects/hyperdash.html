				<h2 id="Section 2">The Vision</h2>
				<p>
					During long car rides I'd get lost in podcasts like Ear Biscuits, Dear Hank and John, Watchtime, and
					Distractible. I'd listen to these funny and charismatic people ramble on for hours on end, but eventually I
					wondered whether I could start my own podcast. I could talk about whatever I was interested in, which probably
					ended up being videogames, and Hyperdash was born.
				</p>

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>What's in a name</h3>
					<p>
						Hyperdash was named after a move from the speedrunning community of a popular indie platformer game,
						Celeste.
					</p>
				</div>

					Josh, my co-host for the later part of Hyperdash's run, was kind enough to join me and talk about Hyperdash.
					Hey Josh!
				</p>

				<p class="josh">hallo eddie!</p>

				<p>So Josh's font will look like that and my font will look like this.</p>

				<p>
					We needed a new logo, and since the podcast was about video games, I just put the name on a simple pattern in
					Photoshop and put the logos of our favorite games on there.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 3">Studio</h2>
				<p>
					There's not a lot of equipment you need to podcast - it's pretty much exactly what you expect. A microphone,
					audio editing software, and some way to upload your podcasts.
				</p>

				<p>
					The microphone I use was the same one I use to stream and record YouTube videos (read more about those
					adventures here). It's the <a href="https://amzn.to/4fJUCuM" target="_blank">Fifine K669</a> and I've got it
					on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3DOJwrd" target="_blank">budget mic stand</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Those are affiliate links, by the way. I may get a small commission with no extra cost to you. The rest of the
					amazon links on this page are all also affiliate links.
				</p>

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>Upgrades</h3>
					<p>
						I've since upgraded to the <a href="https://amzn.to/42pgbxV" target="_blank">Beacn mic</a>, pictured above,
						but they look mostly the same, except the Beacn mic is about twice the size of the Fifine K669. Also, my
						Fifine K669 happened to be a disgusting color only describable as dark pink—because, of course, the black
						one was more expensive.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Anyways, the mic and the mic stand are both pretty cheap, but they get the job done. Since I use Adobe
					Audition and its audio effects and filters for processing the audio, I can make it sound a lot better than the
					price tag indicates.
				</p>

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>Decorations</h3>
					<p>I added those decorations later: a small D.Va backpack hanger and a Princess Celestia figurine.</p>
				</div>

				<p class="josh">
					my mic setup for Hyperdash wasn't anything too special. but to give a bit of backstory, before covid hit, my
					dad purchased a Blue Blackout Spark SL to potentially record some of his music with a couple of his friends.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/joshPeep.jpg" alt="Josh peeping the mic" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p class="josh">
					but alas, covid changed the entire world—and my potential microphone. fast forward two years and as i was
					searching for an upgrade from my Razer Kraken X headset, i remembered a microphone in a cabinet that never got
					the chance to be used.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/joshOldMicArm.jpg" alt="Josh's setup from 2023" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p class="josh">
					ever since then, i've used this mic for more than Hyperdash: calls, recordings for eddie's YouTube channel (<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2okKzouxrI"
						target="_blank"
						>this</a
					>
					one was my favorite, but he can tell you more about that), and your typical microphone uses as well.
				</p>
				<p class="josh">
					back then, i had my mic mounted on some cheap amazon mic stand, but i've since upgraded to the Wave Mic Arm LP
					from Elgato; definitely more sturdy than my old one.
