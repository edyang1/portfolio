					<p class="reveal-tldr">
						During long car rides, Eddie found inspiration from podcasts like Ear Biscuits and Distractible, leading to
						the creation of Hyperdash, a podcast centered around video games. Co-hosted with Josh, they navigated the
						challenges of recording, editing, and producing weekly episodes using budget-friendly equipment and a mix of
						software like Audacity, Adobe Audition, and Da Vinci Resolve. While creative approaches like
						Minecraft-inspired visuals added a unique flair, the workload eventually became overwhelming, leading to the
						podcast's hiatus. Despite a small but engaged audience on platforms like Amazon Music, Hyperdash left
						lasting memories and sparked an interest in exploring podcasting again someday. Eddie's experience in an
						English podcasting class further reinforced the creative joy behind such projects.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2 id="Section 2">The Vision</h2>
				<p>
					During long car rides I'd get lost in podcasts like Ear Biscuits, Dear Hank and John, Watchtime, and
					Distractible. I'd listen to these funny and charismatic people ramble on for hours on end, but eventually I
					wondered whether I could start my own podcast. I could talk about whatever I was interested in, which probably
					ended up being videogames, and Hyperdash was born.
				</p>

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>What's in a name</h3>
					<p>
						Hyperdash was named after a move from the speedrunning community of a popular indie platformer game,
						Celeste.
					</p>

					Josh, my co-host for the later part of Hyperdash's run, was kind enough to join me and talk about Hyperdash.
					Hey Josh!
				</p>

				<p class="josh">hallo eddie!</p>

				<p>So Josh's font will look like that and my font will look like this.</p>

				<p>
					We needed a new logo, and since the podcast was about video games, I just put the name on a simple pattern in
					Photoshop and put the logos of our favorite games on there.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 3">Studio</h2>
				<p>
					There's not a lot of equipment you need to podcast - it's pretty much exactly what you expect. A microphone,
					audio editing software, and some way to upload your podcasts.
				</p>

				<p>
					The microphone I use was the same one I use to stream and record YouTube videos (read more about those
					adventures here). It's the <a href="https://amzn.to/4fJUCuM" target="_blank">Fifine K669</a> and I've got it
					on a <a href="https://amzn.to/3DOJwrd" target="_blank">budget mic stand</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Those are affiliate links, by the way. I may get a small commission with no extra cost to you. The rest of the
					amazon links on this page are all also affiliate links.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/beacnMic.jpg" alt="Beacn Mic" class="article-image reveal" />

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>Upgrades</h3>
					<p>
						I've since upgraded to the <a href="https://amzn.to/42pgbxV" target="_blank">Beacn mic</a>, pictured above,
						but they look mostly the same, except the Beacn mic is about twice the size of the Fifine K669. Also, my
						Fifine K669 happened to be a disgusting color only describable as dark pink—because, of course, the black
						one was more expensive.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Anyways, the mic and the mic stand are both pretty cheap, but they get the job done. Since I use Adobe
					Audition and its audio effects and filters for processing the audio, I can make it sound a lot better than the
					price tag indicates.
				</p>

				<div class="tidbit-container reveal">
					<h3>Decorations</h3>
					<p>I added those decorations later: a small D.Va backpack hanger and a Princess Celestia figurine.</p>
				</div>

				<p class="josh">
					my mic setup for Hyperdash wasn't anything too special. but to give a bit of backstory, before covid hit, my
					dad purchased a Blue Blackout Spark SL to potentially record some of his music with a couple of his friends.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/joshPeep.jpg" alt="Josh peeping the mic" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p class="josh">
					but alas, covid changed the entire world—and my potential microphone. fast forward two years and as i was
					searching for an upgrade from my Razer Kraken X headset, i remembered a microphone in a cabinet that never got
					the chance to be used.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/joshOldMicArm.jpg" alt="Josh's setup from 2023" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p class="josh">
					ever since then, i've used this mic for more than Hyperdash: calls, recordings for eddie's YouTube channel (<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2okKzouxrI"
						target="_blank"
						>this</a
					>
					one was my favorite, but he can tell you more about that), and your typical microphone uses as well.
				</p>
				<p class="josh">
					back then, i had my mic mounted on some cheap amazon mic stand, but i've since upgraded to the Wave Mic Arm LP
					from Elgato; definitely more sturdy than my old one.
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/joshNewMicArm.jpg" alt="New mic stand" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p>
					For processing, we split up the work to match our skills: I handled editing audio and Josh handled editing the
					videos and thumbnails.
				</p>

				<p>
					As for the software we used, fasten your harness. In total I used 3 programs: Audacity, Adobe Audition, and Da
					Vinci Resolve. I used Audacity to record, Adobe Audition to apply filters to the audio, and Da Vinci Resolve
					to cut and add music and sound effects to the audio. Realistically, I only needed one: Adobe Audition.
					Thankfully the university provides the Adobe suite to its students so I could access this industry leading
					software for “free”. I'm not sure why I used Audacity to record. I know Josh doesn't have access to Adobe
					Audition so I showed him how to use Audacity, but I could have just recorded in Audition. And I consciously
					chose to use DaVinci Resolve to cut and add effects to the audio. I was far more used to editing in DaVinci
					Resolve and was too lazy to learn new key bindings and shortcuts in Audition.
				</p>

				<p>Josh, over to you. What did you use to edit the videos and thumbnails?</p>

				<p class="josh">
					i used Filmora, a not-so-known editing software, but one that i had used for almost 3 years on personal
					projects at the time of Hyperdash's inception. we wanted Hyperdash to have its own unique flair, but still
					took inspiration & formats from other podcasts we listened to. when planning the podcast, eddie and i both
					knew how we couldn't use our actual faces; not only that we didn't want to, but we just didn't have the
					equipment at the time to do so. so, we opted to use Minecraft (yes, the “block game”) as a way of putting a
					“face” on the voices that you, the viewer, would be hearing. we focused on accomplishing this goal on YouTube,
					one of the different platforms we ended up utilizing, but the only platform where we could make videos &
					thumbnails.
				</p>
				<p class="josh">
					editing the videos was BY FAR the most tedious part of this whole process. from building sets in-game, to get
					the lighting just right, and then to use a community-made mod (<a
						href="https://www.replaymod.com/"
						target="_blank"
						>Replay Mod</a
					>
					by CrushedPixel and johni0702) to record all of the footage. like any other major podcast with a youtube
					channel, we recreated the whole “feel” of a two-person (albeit, with
					<a href="https://youtu.be/t0r9rBBqJhc?t=1406" target="_blank">one exception</a>) podcast quite successfully in
					my eyes.
				</p>
				<p class="josh">
					then came the thumbnails, unlike eddie, i didn't have educational access to Adobe's Creative Cloud programs,
					notably Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and After Effects. i ended up using a web-based, free version of Adobe's
					Photoshop called Photopea, which is where all of the episodes' thumbnails were made. for every thumbnail, i
					wanted to make sure that at least one of the characters' faces were included, keeping that “putting a face on
					the voice” mantra in mind. out of all of the thumbnails that were posted onto the Hyperdash channel, my
					favorite out of all of them would have to be the thumbnail for
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzMBePbIuwo" target="_blank">The Chocolate Connoisseur</a> or Episode
					13.

				<p>
					For uploading the podcasts, we just used Spotify for Creators, which was previously named Anker. It was the
					best free option out there, and let us get our podcast directly onto big platforms like Spotify, Amazon music,
					Apple podcasts, and many more.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 4">Process</h2>

				<p>
					After making a few episodes, Josh and I got into a rhythm. The basic plan was simple: we planned out our
					episodes, recorded them, edited them, and uploaded them. Throughout the week Josh and I would note down
					anything interesting that happened during our weeks or any news we want to discuss. Our plans ended up looking
					like this:
				</p>

				<img src="../images/hyperdash/hyperdashPlan.png" alt="Hyperdash Plan" class="article-image reveal" />

				<p>
					When it came to recording, we just set it up, and … talked. Considering the lack of planning we did (we
					loosely followed the outline and yapped) it's a miracle our episodes were remotely coherent.
				</p>

				<p>
					Every good podcast has a recognizable intro. I don't know how it started, but starting in episode 10 (Devious
					Ways to Serve Breakfast), we always began with:
				</p>

				<p>
					Welcome back to the Hyperdash Podcast, where two friends hang out, tell stories, and talk about video games.
					I'm Eddie.
				</p>

				<p class="josh">And I'm Josh.</p>

				<p>This week, ...</p>

				<p>
					We'd always start off by asking each other “would you rather” questions. I think our best one was “would you
					rather eat a baby goat or a matter baby”.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 5">Our favorite moments</h2>

				Probably one of my favorite moments is when I talked about becoming the “Banana Bandit” at my university.

				<iframe
					style="border-radius: 12px"

				<p>
					I'll spare the full story but it's about how I got posted on my school's social media page as the “banana
					bandit” after being caught red-handed taking too many bananas out of the dining hall.
				</p>

				<p class="josh">
					i have two very fond memories from Hyperdash: firstly, the “Metro Fire” bit from Devious Ways to Eat Breakfast
					or Episode 10. or, our collective discovery of the “Djungelskog” and other IKEA names in Djungelskog and the
					Return of the Chocolate Connoisseur or Episode 15, starting from the 22:15 timestamp on Spotify.

				<h2 id="Section 6">Farewell (for now)</h2>

				<p>
					But making a new episode every week stretched us too thin. After all, it was planning, recording, editing
					audio, and editing video every single week. We decided to cut back and stop making episodes. It was too much
					to keep up with.
				</p>

				<p>
					There was this tool that I saw and considered buying called AutoPod that would have greatly simplified Josh's
					process for editing the videos, but we didn't end up getting it.
				</p>

				<p>
					In retrospect, buying (or pirating) AutoPod would have been worth it, especially because I had the money to
					spare and it would have simplified the process of editing the video a ton. Investing in hobbies (in
					moderation) is worth it for personal enjoyment.
				</p>

				<p>
					Incidentally, I was streaming modded Minecraft one day when I had a chatter come in and ask me why we stopped
					uploading. I didn't think we had too many engaged listeners from the metrics, but this person said they were
					from Amazon Music (which also offers podcasts). After the stream I logged into my analytics page for Amazon
					Podcasts and was surprised to see several consistently engaged listeners, and then I felt guilty for
					disappearing, especially without saying anything.
				</p>

				<p>
					I hadn't even realized that we had built a small audience on Amazon Music: I was so focused on metrics for
					Spotify and YouTube that I completely ignored looking at the numbers for other platforms.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 7">ENGL 384</h2>
				<p>
					Though my focus is on computer science and business, I want to take classes in English if my schedule allows
					it because reading and writing interest me. I also find that a lot of my hobbies involve a creative writing
					aspect, and of course writing is a skill you'll use for the rest of your life. But I digress.
				</p>

				<p>
					Signing up for classes in my 1st year spring semester, I came across a class called ENGL 384 - Podcasting, and
					figured I could learn something new from it. My professor was fantastic and I ended up making an episode about
					a personal narrative and one in which I interviewed my sister's girlfriend about her time in her tech career.
					Generally I've found English professors to be wonderful and chill people, and that class was pretty fun.
					Despite hyperdash's rather short stint, I'll keep my options open to running a podcast again some day.■
