				<!-- Introduction Section -->
				<h2 id="Section 2">Photography</h2>
				<p>
					My father was always an adventurer. I remember when I accompanied him on his photography trips, waking up at 5
					AM to catch the rolling hills of Washington as the sun hit them right in the morning, and driving through a
					wildlife preserve to capture black skimmer birds that glided just over the surface of a marsh. But in all of
					my wildlife photography trips with him, by far the best opportunity I've ever had was that in the Maasai Mara
					in Kenya.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 3">Studio</h2>
				<p>
					The camera of choice was a Nikon Z9 mirrorless camera. This cutting edge (at the time, and even today) camera
					could capture 20 pictures a second with incredible quality, with state of the art autofocus capabilities.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 4">Process</h2>
				<p>
					When we arrived in Kenya, we had the guidance of professional photographer Jeffrey Wu, who guided us along
					this two-week journey. His extensive connections in Kenya included our Jeep driver, who knew the behavior of
					the animals better than anyone. When we were out on a safari, he knew where to position the truck to get
					optimal angles for the photos.

					One morning, we took photos of african fish eagles that swooped down over a lake to catch fish in its talons.

				<p>
					This zebra is moments away from being taken down by a cheetah. Sometimes, we had to wait for hours as the
					cheetah singled out a zebra and stalked its prey.

					A cow herder and his herd of cows kick up dust in the morning sun. This is by far my favorite shot from the
					trip.

				<p>This is a pan shot of a lion walking. I think it's cool how the background is blurred.</p>

				<p>I was so lucky to see a great wildebeest migration, where they had to jump and wade across a river.</p>

				<p>This lion cub jumps on top of its mom. Cute!</p>

				<p>Two lion cubs play fight.</p>

				<p>Another photo of the wildebeest jumping.</p>

				<p>
					Overall, this trip was incredible, and I got some amazing shots and experienced a safari for the first time.
					It was incredible being so close to the action, watching the cold hard reality of nature as apex predators
					devoured the zebras and wildebeests alive.â–
