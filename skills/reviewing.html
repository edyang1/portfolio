					Pretend you like dark chocolate and you're savoring a bar you got at the grocery store. Note the earthy smell.
					Creamy texture. Fruity notes. The way it breaks apart when you chew on it, then how it melts in your mouth.
					Does it taste how you expect good chocolate to taste?
				</p>
				<p>Congratulations, you are now a chocolate connoisseur! Well, you're basically halfway there.</p>

				<h2 id="Section 3">Handbags</h2>
				<p>
					One time, I was in San Francisco, walking down an avenue with a bunch of designer shops. I've since forgotten
					which one, maybe Gucci, maybe Moncler, maybe BVLGARI. This humongous dude, a full block of muscle, 6 feet
					tall, decked out in a gray suit, let us into the shop. All the designer shops have these huge dudes, probably
					for asset protection (and maybe a little bit of cool factor). The whole shop, walls to ceilings, were lined
					with lavish furniture and expensive clothing. Walking around, I inspected dresses worth hundreds and handbags
					worth thousands. As I looked around, a question started to bother me: why are they so expensive? I'm used to
					expensive stuff being high quality or functional, and I expected these purses to be pristine. So I inspected
					them. I didn't know a lot about leather, or fashion, for that matter, but I still tried to compare it to other
					handbags I've seen, or my own handbag. The clothing and accessories were high quality, had perfect stitching,
					and their materials felt nice, but how do I explain the price tag of several thousand dollars?
				</p>
				<p>
					I started really paying attention to the kinds of things I was consuming after I got back into reading a
					couple months ago. I was worried that I might forget about the books I've read a few months after I read them,
					so I gave myself a little exercise after I read each book: flip back through, gather my thoughts, and write a
					short review. It did wonders. For a couple minutes that it takes, it ties up any loose ends I had in my
					understanding and forces me to slow downs and think about what I just read.
				</p>
				<p>
					And I realized that I could get a little more enjoyment out of everything that I did, including playing video
					games and eating, for example, if I slowed down and reviewed, or at least spent a minute being mindful, about
					what I was consuming.
				</p>
				<p>
					I leave reviews all the time now, especially on
					<a href="https://eddiereviewseverything.wordpress.com/category/book-review/" target="_blank">books</a> and
					<a href="https://eddiereviewseverything.wordpress.com/category/game-review/" target="_blank">video games</a>
					(and it's helpful for the artists, so it's a win-win!). I've compiled them into a blog I call
					<a href="https://eddiereviewseverything.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">eddie reviews everything</a>. And
					while I try to keep them mostly objective with my critique, I will also put in my subjective opinions,
					although I hope to make it clear that they are, indeed, opinions.

				<p>
					This is all to say that reviewing is just the act of slowing down, and being mindful of the things you
					consume. Noticing the small details and being curious. Asking why you have a reaction to something, and maybe
					trying to appreciate things you don't subjectively like.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Section 4">A review review</h2>
				<p>
					And for my last trick, I will perform the world's first review review, a review of
					<a

						>my review of The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett.</a

					Prepare to be amazed.

					<h3>The Maltese Falcon</h3>
					<p>
						I'll admit: this was above my reading level. And although I didn't understand some of the vocabulary, I
						could still appreciate the way that Hammet is able to craft good sentences and a captivating plot.
					</p>
					<p>
						The novel was published in the 1930's, and starkly reminds you of the different social attitudes of the
						time: strong archetypes of the femme fatale, bad guy with a foreign accent, and hard-boiled detective are
						present.
					</p>
					<p>
						The object that everyone was up in arms about, the Maltese Falcon (a black statuette of a falcon), had its
						entrance interestingly delayed until the end of the novel, in the last couple chapters, building suspense
						throughout.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, I found that the plot started painfully slowly, and it was hard to understand what actually
						happened after the denouement. I acknowledge my insufficient reading comprehension, but I was able to
						clarify the ending by watching some clips of the movie and reading summaries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Subjectively, I found it harder to read, but that doesn't stop this book from being objectively good. It
						practically defines the genre of the hard-boiled-detective mystery novel. 7/10

					This review has a ton of information packed into it, and has a nice flow to it. I like the commentary that
					circumstances were different when this novel was written. I can notice that the reviewer let some subjective
					points blend in with the review, Although it's nice that the reviewer was aware and recognized this. Some more
					depth would be great, but at least we didn't spoil the novel. 7/10
