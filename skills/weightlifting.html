            <h2 id="Section 2">Weightlifting is the art of lifting heavy rocks.</h2>
            <p>In the winter of 11th grade, my friend dragged me into the gym. I had been, up until that point, in
                staunch opposition
                to keeping my body healthy, instead focusing mostly on school, video games, and playing instruments. I
                was extremely
                scrawny, and a little tubby at the same time, and really bad at pretty much every sport. Thankfully I
                wasn't made fun of
                in gym class (although funnily enough, I was on good terms with the jocks). Anyways, it's 11th grade,
                and my friend
                invited me to work out after school at our school's strength center. After a lot of convincing, I did my
                first workout.
                And I was hooked.
            </p>

            <p>Since then I've done 5 workouts a week for several years, and that consistency has led to gains I'm proud
                of (though
                there's always higher to go on that ladder!). It's been a great way to de-stress and listen to music and
                also great for
                my body (and mind!).
            </p>

            <p>The funny part is that having large muscles doesn't necessarily make you athletic, or should I say,
                doesn't make you
                good at every sport. I still suck at pretty much everything that requires practice, dexterity, or lots
                of endurance. I
                could maybe beat you in ping pong, though.

                <h3>Hypertrophy
                </h3>
                <p>Hypertrophy is when you lift heavy rocks, and your muscles adapt and the cells (i.e. the muscle
                    fibers themselves) grow
                    larger in size.

                <h3>Progressive Overload
                </h3>
                <p>The ancient Greeks figured out that if you lifted super heavy rocks, your muscles would get used to
                    it, and you would be
                    able to lift slightly heavier rocks the next time. Thus, the name is self-explanatory: we
                    progressively overload our
                    body by gradually increasing the intensity of our workouts so we'll always be challenged.

            <p>The gym might be intimidating at first (trust me, it was for me) but from my experience, most gym rats
                are chill (we're all there for personal improvement, after all). So get out there and start lifting!â–
